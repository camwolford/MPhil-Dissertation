### Filter IVs ###
# This script filters the IVs based on the following criteria:
# 1. Exclude SNPs with a p-value > 5e-8 # Check if this is the right threshold
# 2. Exclude SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.01 # Check if this is the right threshold
# 3. Exclude SNPs that are shared with more than 5 metabolites]
